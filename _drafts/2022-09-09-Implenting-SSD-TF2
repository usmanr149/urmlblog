Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) detects objects in images using a single deep neural network. In this blog post I will cover how to implement SSD300 (meaning images are 300x300) detector presented <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> in Tensorflow 2.0.

# What do we Need?

SSD needs an input image with ground truth boxes for each objects. In addition we also need default boxes (also called anchor boxes), for each default box we predict the offset and the confidence score for all object categories.



At training time, the default boxes are matched to the ground truth boxes. The matched boxes are treated as positives and the rest of the default boxes are treated as negative. The model loss is a weighted sum between localization loss and confidence loss.
