title: Implement and Apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Classifier -- Exercise
---

I am currently listening to the lectures for 
[CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv&index=1)
I will post my solutions to the [programming exercises](http://cs231n.github.io/) attached with this course here.

In this exercise we are asked to train a k-NN classifier on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, 
with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

### Using Two Loops to Calculate Distances

This is rather simple, we need to calculate the Euclidean distance between each point in 
out testing and training dataset. We have already reshaped the CIFAR-10 data into single 
rows. So the distance between test data *i* and train data *j* is given as

$$
\begin{align*}
  dist[i,j] = \sqrt{(\sum_{dim=1}^{dim=3072} (X\_train[j][dim] - X\_ test[i][dim])^2}
\end{align*}
$$

Another way to write this as a dot product:

$$
\begin{align*}
  dist[i,j] = \sqrt{(X\_ train[j] - X\_test[i]) \cdot (X\_ train[j] - X\_test[i])}
\end{align*}
$$

Here is the code implemented in python:

```python
num_test = X.shape[0]
num_train = self.X_train.shape[0]
dists = np.zeros((num_test, num_train))
for i in range(num_test):
    for j in range(num_train):
        v_sub = X[i] - self.X_train[j]
        dists[i, j] = np.sqrt(v_sub.dot(v_sub))
```

This is what the distance matrix between the training (X-axis) and testing set (Y-axis)
looks like.

The bright in the image above indicate test images that are very similar to a variety 
of training images based on a simple Euclidean distance. This would also imply that the image classification for the images with bright rows will not be very reliable.

Similarly for bright columns, the training images would be very similar 
to all images in the test set based on simple Euclidean distance.

### Using One Loop to Calculate Distances

We can use some numpy magic to reduce to calculate the distance matrix with just one loop

```python
num_test = X.shape[0]
num_train = self.X_train.shape[0]
dists = np.zeros((num_test, num_train))
for i in range(num_test):
    v_sub = self.X_train - X[i]
    dists[i] = np.sqrt(np.sum(v_sub**2, axis=1))
```

### Using No Loop to Calculate Distances

We can simplify the calculation even further to the point where we don't need to use
any loops.

$$
\begin{align*}
  dist &= \begin{pmatrix}
(X\_train[0] - X\_test[0]) \cdot (X\_train[0] - X\_test[0]) & (X\_train[1] - X\_test[0]) \cdot (X\_train[1] - X\_test[0]) & \dots & 
(X\_train[5000] - X\_test[0]) \cdot (X\_train[5000] - X\_test[0]) \\
(X\_train[0] - X\_test[1]) \cdot (X\_train[0] - X\_test[1]) & (X\_train[1] - X\_test[1]) \cdot (X\_train[1] - X\_test[1]) & \dots & 
(X\_train[5000] - X\_test[1]) \cdot (X\_train[5000] - X\_test[1]) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\
(X\_train[0] - X\_test[500]) \cdot (X\_train[0] - X\_test[500]) & (X\_train[1] - X\_test[500]) \cdot (X\_train[1] - X\_test[500]) & \dots 
 & (X\_train[5000] - X\_test[500]) \cdot (X\_train[5000] - X\_test[500])\\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

We can simplify the matrices above as follows

$$
\begin{align*}
dist = \begin{pmatrix}
X\_train[0] \cdot X\_train[0] & X\_train[1] \cdot X\_train[1] & \dots & X\_train[5000] \cdot X\_train[5000] \\
X\_train[0] \cdot X\_train[0] & X\_train[1] \cdot X\_train[1] & \dots & 
X\_train[5000] \cdot X\_train[5000] \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\
X\_train[0] \cdot X\_train[0] & X\_train[1] \cdot X\_train[1] & \dots 
 & X\_train[5000] \cdot X\_train[5000]\\
\end{pmatrix} \\
+ \begin{pmatrix}
X\_test[0] \cdot X\_test[0] & X\_test[0] \cdot X\_test[0] & \dots & X\_test[0] \cdot X\_test[0] \\
X\_test[1] \cdot X\_test[1] & X\_test[1] \cdot X\_test[1] & \dots & X\_test[1] \cdot X\_test[1] \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\
X\_test[500] \cdot X\_test[500] & X\_test[500] \cdot X\_test[500] & \dots & X\_test[500] \cdot X\_test[500]\\
\end{pmatrix}\\
-2*\begin{pmatrix}
X\_train[0] \cdot X\_test[0] & X\_train[1] \cdot X\_test[0] & \dots & X\_train[5000] \cdot X\_test[0] \\
X\_train[0] \cdot X\_test[1] & X\_train[1] \cdot X\_test[1] & \dots & X\_train[5000] \cdot X\_test[1] \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\
X\_train[0] \cdot X\_test[500] & X\_train[1] \cdot X\_test[500]) & \dots & X\_train[5000] \cdot X\_test[500]\\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

This is not the most intuitive way to think about this but we can actually use numpy 
to do the matrix calculations above in a single line.

```python
dists = (self.X_train**2).sum(axis=1) + (X**2).sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis] - 2*X.dot(self.X_train.T)
```

Here is how long each version of the code takes to run on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

```
Two loop version took 21.103897 seconds
One loop version took 39.334489 seconds
No loop version took 0.198159 seconds
```

As stated in the assignment notes: 

```
# NOTE: depending on what machine you're using, 
# you might not see a speedup when you go from two loops to one loop, 
# and might even see a slow-down.
```
